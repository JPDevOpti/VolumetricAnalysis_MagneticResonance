This project focuses on the volumetric analysis of brain regions using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. It compares brain region volumes between different groups (GW and GK) and provides statistical analysis and visualization of the results.

## 📋 Project Overview

The analysis includes:
- 🔍 Comparison of brain region volumes between GW and GK groups
- 📊 Statistical analysis of volume differences
- 🎨 Visualization of results using professional-grade plots
- 📈 Percentage difference calculations between groups

## 🛠️ Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:
- 📊 pandas
- 📈 matplotlib
- 🎨 seaborn
- 🔢 numpy

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VolumetricAnalysis_MagneticResonance.git
cd VolumetricAnalysis_MagneticResonance
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

The main analysis is performed in the Jupyter notebook `Notebooks/Volumetric_Analysis.ipynb`. The notebook contains:
- 📥 Data loading and preprocessing
- 📊 Statistical analysis
